Love to Hate Me

Yellowjackets' vocalist, Shauna Shipman, is everyone's dream girl… except Jackie Taylor's apparently. After the actress outright rejects her in public, Shauna decides to do everything she can to exact revenge.

Introducing: The Band

-pop rock trio that went big bcs they are gay and attractive
-they have quite an insane fanbase (pls dont mess with them in stan twt) 
-they are about to release their sophomore album so there will be a lot of promotions coming up! 

![](Images/F9oFxasaUAAtFci.jpg)


Shauna Shipman 

-vocalist and songwriter to Yellowjackets
-surprisingly, the one with the least social media presence among the trio
-that's good because she didn't pay attention to media training and will be prone to say things that would be a PR nightmare 

![](Images/F9oGqm3bkAA65My.jpg) 

![](Images/F9oGq1LbAAAfrZP.jpg)


Natalie Scatorccio

-vocalist and guitarist
-somehow, the most stanned member because she actually does interact with fans (mostly through memes in her ig stories) 
-shaunanat is a huge ship in the fandom but she has no clue why 

![](Images/F9oHmn8awAA6ZZ9.jpg)


Van Palmer

-drummer
-the member that actively interacts with fans and actually enjoys the attention
-movie buff who forces shauna and nat to watch A24 movies on the day of release
-huge jackie taylor stan 

![](Images/F9oIafyb0AAaznH.jpg)


Ben Scott

-manager of the yjs
-please pray for him bcs he will go through a lot (shauna being shauna) in this AU
-huuuge believer of fan service 
-"all publicity is good publicity" he says as he cries himself to sleep 

![](Images/F9oJK0nbsAAWQ5F.jpg)


And last but not the least (for now)...

Jackie Taylor

-the indie darling who is starting to go mainstream 
-fanbase mostly made up of lesbians bcs she kissed a girl once for a film and they are invested ever since
-a yellowjackets casual enjoyer (1 guess on who is her fave)

ARC 2

With the YJs put on hiatus after the KYSGate, Shauna is jobless. But that doesn't mean she has nothing else to do. Her goal? Wipe that smug grin off Jackie's face by starring alongside her in a new film. 

Her only problem? Lottie Matthews is gunning for the same role.

End of Arc 3! 

I really wish I had the foresight to split this arc but I was so intent for that last update to be the ending that I ended up not doing it. That said, a lot more will happen in the next arc. I'll be posting a bunch of other things before Arc 4 starts so stay tuned <video controls><source src="Images/GFhOuvtakAAkvSQ.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>


Arc 4

PR relationships are no joke, especially when you are dealing with confusing crushes and doomed croomfships. As Jackie grapples with her growing feelings for her fake girlfriend, Shauna continues her crusade to win her estranged croomf back... (contd in pic #1)

Does anyone have spare diamonds for Jackie? Hfjdjdjd 

I hope you enjoyed this weekend's update rollout and hope you are having a ball with all the mystery! It's always fun watching you all (try to) guess the twists haha. 

Talk to me in my CC pleek https://t.co/IgVF62GQcf


❗️LTHM 💎💎💎 MINE ❗️ 

LTHM will now be a semi-interactive AU so there will be more "divergence points" in the future!

The readers will get their first diamond IF we are able to able to reach $2500 within the next 2 days! (contd) 

![](Images/GHOKhIRa0AA6e-G.jpg)


Depending on what happens, I will be publishing a poll with Jackie's choices from the last update. 

If the diamond option doesn't win, you are able to use that in the next divergence point! Take note that mining diamonds might be harder next time lol 

https://t.co/MqrRKZGzsh 

![](Images/GHOLF7LbUAAO7Yn.jpg)


Guys! We just reached $2500 in record time lmfao. Why did I even give you 2 days? Lol! If we reach $3000, the readers will have 2 diamonds to use for some power over me and LTHM lol! 

Also: there are wonderful artists supporting this drive! Please check the available slots! 

![](Images/GHOQ4dtasAAAp-E.png)


Link to the original post!

I'm on my hands and knees for some LTHM fanart so if an artist who reads it is available, feel free to request for it lmfao jk (no pressure! you all are already amazing) 

https://t.co/3mZkpAglpr


💎 You have 1 diamond 💎

Poll available now! It will be up for the next 24 hours and the results will only be revealed once the update is posted!
